# Security Advisory: Potential Misconfiguration Vulnerability in WordPress Automation Scripts

## Summary
A potential vulnerability has been identified in the WordPress automation scripts (`wp-full-control.sh.x`, `wp-rds.sh.x`, and `uni.sh.x`). Improper handling of sensitive configurations, such as database credentials or permissions, may expose systems to unauthorized access or data leaks.

This advisory applies to all versions of the scripts currently available in the repository. Users are strongly advised to review and secure their deployments.

---

## Affected Versions
The following scripts and versions are affected:
- `wp-full-control.sh.x`: All versions
- `wp-rds.sh.x`: All versions
- `uni.sh.x`: All versions

---

## Severity
**High**

---

## Impact
1. **Misconfigured Database Credentials**: If default credentials are left unchanged, attackers may gain access to your database.
2. **Improper File Permissions**: Inadequately secured files (e.g., `wp-config.php`) may allow unauthorized access to sensitive information.
3. **Publicly Accessible Scripts**: If the scripts are exposed on a publicly accessible server, attackers may manipulate or exploit them.

---

## Resolution
We recommend users take the following actions to mitigate potential risks:

### Update to Secure Credentials
1. Change all default database credentials to strong, unique passwords.
2. Use the included additional script to securely update database credentials post-installation.

### Secure File Permissions
1. Ensure the WordPress configuration file (`wp-config.php`) is restricted to the web server:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 600 /var/www/html/wp-config.php
   ```
2. Remove or restrict access to unnecessary files or directories.

### Secure Access to the Scripts
1. Do not expose `.sh.x` files in publicly accessible directories.
2. Use server-level access controls (e.g., firewalls, IP restrictions).

---

## Mitigation
If you are unable to apply the recommended resolution immediately:
- Restrict access to the EC2 instance running the scripts using Security Groups.
- Remove or rename any unnecessary files that could expose sensitive information.
- Regularly monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts.

---

## Technical Details
The issue arises from:
- Use of default credentials during WordPress setup.
- Publicly accessible automation scripts without proper access control.
- Insecure file and folder permissions after script execution.

Attackers could exploit these weaknesses by:
1. Guessing or accessing default credentials to compromise the database.
2. Accessing sensitive configuration files if file permissions are not set correctly.
3. Running exposed scripts to manipulate server configurations.
